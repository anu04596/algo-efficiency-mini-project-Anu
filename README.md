# üìò Algorithms Repository

## **Algorithmic Strategies & Implementations**  

This repository contains Python implementations, experiments, and analyses of fundamental and applied algorithms.  
It serves as a mini-project and practice workspace for **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**.  

The repo is organized into multiple sections:  

- **Classical Algorithms**  
  - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)  
  - Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort)  

- **Advanced Algorithmic Strategies (Mini Project)**  
  - **Greedy**: TV Commercial Scheduling (Job Sequencing)  
  - **Dynamic Programming**: 0/1 Knapsack (Maximizing Profit under Budget)  
  - **Backtracking**: Sudoku Solver  
  - **Brute-Force**: Password Cracking (Naive)  

Each algorithm is implemented in Python, profiled for time and space, and supported with visualizations (plots).

## **‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run**
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anu04596/algo-efficiency-mini-project-Anu.git
   cd algo-efficiency-mini-project-Anu
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
   venv\Scripts\activate    # (Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run individual algorithms from their folder, e.g.:
   ```bash
   python codes/sorting.ipynb
   python codes/searching.ipynb
   ```
