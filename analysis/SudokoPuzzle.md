**Problem : Sudoku Solver (Backtracking)**

Time Complexity Analysis : 
The runtime grows rapidly as the number of empty cells increases. With 20â€“30 blanks, puzzles are solved quickly, but beyond 40 blanks, the runtime spikes sharply, confirming the exponential nature of backtracking (**O(9^k)**, where k is the number of blanks).

Space Complexity Analysis : 
Memory usage grows linearly with recursion depth, which increases with the number of blanks. Although the footprint is small (a few KB), it reflects the **O(k)** stack requirement.

Time vs Blanks Analysis : 
The time vs empty cells plot illustrates the exponential difficulty: more blanks mean more branching in the search tree. This validates why Sudoku solvers handle typical puzzles easily but struggle with sparse grids.
